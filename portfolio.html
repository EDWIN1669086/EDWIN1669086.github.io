            <h3 class="heading">Description of Game:</h3>
                <p>Fish Frenzy is a single player survival game in the 
                perspective of a cute, orange fish. Your goal is to grow big by eating
                the blue fishes and the algae for one growth point, and to win the game
                you must get 10 growth points. However, getting touched by a bigger 
                fish results in minus points. I implemented a point scoring system 
                where if the fish touches its food it gains a point, but if it's touches
                by a predator it loses points. The game gets more difficult once the 
                player reaches 7 points because the shark comes in to chase the fish.
                The game ends when the player gets to negative growth points 
                (meaning he/she died) by other fish and is notified by the the loss screen.</p>
            <h3 class="heading">Reflection:</h3>
                <p>I made this game because I imagined a game where a sprite could eat 
                other sprites and get eaten by others too and it just happened to 
                take place in a oceanic environment. Two successful points from the 
                development of this game are that I was able to utilize the "point to
                mousepointer" to enable my sprite to move in the direction of my mouse
                and that I was able to create an "animated" home screen. Two obstacles 
                I encountered were having the home screen fish appear uniformly because 
                they were located in different spots and having the point system change
                when the orange fish touched a predator. To overcome these, I had to 
                put the fishes in the same location and have them go at different times 
                in the home screen and for the point system, I just had to put the point 
                system code onto the predator rather than the orange fish. If I had 
                more time or resources, I would have made more types of animals and 
                maybe even a rare clam at the bottom for instant victory to make it 
                more entertaining. 
                </p>
            <h3 class="heading">Code:</h3>

            <img class="left2" src="moreblocks.PNG">
            <p>This code is an algorithm because it is a step by step process 
            consisting of two forever loops and two conditionals. Once the play
            button is clicked which broadcasts "game", if growth points is greater
            than 6.5 at that moment, it will go to x position -220
            and any y position between -180 and 180. It will then show the shark
            and forever move toward the mouse at a 2.5 step rate. If the shark is 
            touching the cute fish, then it will hide. For the more blocks, I 
            noticed I needed to change the growth constantly and hide the sprite 
            right after so I made it into its own blocks. </p>
